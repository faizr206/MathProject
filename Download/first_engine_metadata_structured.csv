0Ed-5hq7AdE_30_40.wav,Rolls Royce Dart 510 Turbo Prop Engine Turning over,"This is a Rolls Royce Dart 510 turbo prop being turned over using a 24 volt battery.
The engine is mounted on a Rolls Royce Spey engine stand and is currently missing a 28volt battery, a cracker box and some more gauges and sensors but will be run up to idle in the near future once we have these.




Dart Mark: 510
Serial No: 12024
Maximum Power output: 1,815 ehp (1,354 kW) (1,630 shp (1,220 kW)) at 15,000 rpm

This Dart was mounted in a Vickers Viscount until it was used to test a Heenan and Froude Dyno up until 1980 and then bought for a few hundred pounds by Roy Millington of Bridgnorth, Shropshire. 



We are unsure of the exact age of this engine but believe it to be 1950's era. If any viewers would like to share any information or knowlege of this engine going off the serial numbers your more than welcome.

This engine will be shown at 'Rally in the Valley' in Bridgnorth in July 11th and 12th 2012.",Rolls Royce,Dart 510,Turbo Prop Engine,Aircraft (formerly Vickers Viscount),Jet Fuel (implied for turbo-prop),off,yes

0hipL0SkXMo_40_50.wav,1992 GMC with Built vortec 355,"This is a 1992 GMC 2500 2wd 5 speed. It originally had a 4.3 v-6, but that blew up. Before I owned it, it was used by an older gentleman for a lawn mowing business and only has 116,000 miles on it.

I had a 355 that I built for my camaro, but this truck came along and needed the engine more. 
Here are the engine specs:

2-bolt 350 block from '99 vortec truck bored .030 over

ARP main studs

Windage tray

Scat 9000 series crank

Eagle 5140 forged 6 inch rods

speed pro hypereutectic 2 valve relief flattop pistons with teflon coated skirts and full floating pins. compression is 9.8:1.

clevite bearings

speed pro 1/16 in moly rings

Rotating assembly was balanced 

Vortec heads that were milled to true them

TPIS ZZ9 hydraulic roller cam (212/226 @ .050 .480/.520 lift)

Comp cams beehive springs with titanium retainers

pushrods are new stock replacements

stock stamped self-aligning rocker arms

Edelbrock performer RPM carbureted vortec intake

holley 670 street avenger carb

stock gm hei distributer 

It has shorty headers and a really nice high flowing y-pipe that I made for it. It has a single 3 inch exhaust with a chambered thrush muffler (flomaster sound). It's not super loud, but it does attract attention. The idle has a nice little lope to it and I get a lot of complements on how it sounds. 

It should put out around 375 hp. maybe a little more. with a little more cam it could be well into the 400's

This engine is probably too much for the truck and would be best suited for a muscle car or street rod. It probably only has 5,000 miles on it, if that. Since the break in oil was drained I have only used synthetic oil.

The truck is in good shape for the year. There is NO RUST in the body and the sheet metal is pretty straight. The rear bumper is slightly pushed in and the tailgate is dented, but works fine. Everything is solid. 

The interior has crank windows, manual locks and a rubber floor mat.

The a/c, cruise control and radio do not work.
The transmission is a NV3500. It works well but the 2nd gear syncros are starting to go. I can drive it fine without grinding.

It's a light 2500. It has the beefy drive shaft and 14-bolt rearend but only has the 6-lug flanges. rear gears are 3.42's and of course it's 2wd.

I would like to get $4,000 for the truck as a runner. I know that's kind of high, but it's a pretty bad-a** engine with hardly any miles on it. It would cost me that much just to build another engine like it.

I will also take $850 for the truck minus engine

Hopefully I have answered any questions you may have

We know this car received regular oil changes at higher than recommended intervals and was well maintained.  It had just had the timing belt changed about two weeks before the problem started.  We believe it is likely the infamous oil gel problem found in many Toyota engines.

Clip of my 1984 Formula One boat just prior to winterizing.  Ambient temp is 39F and engine is fairly cold, it is 9pm at night, so there is much condensation in the exhaust and PCV system.  17' (16.5' actually).  Bought boat 8 years ago on eBay for $1000 with blown upper outdrive and cracked exhaust manifolds on a 4.3L V6 4 barrel.  Fixed it, ran it great for 5 years, then self built and swapped a 1999 GM Vortec truck 350 with aftermarket roller camshaft, full stainless roller rockers, aluminum intake, 750cfm carb, aluminum exhaust mainfolds, electric fuel pump, Mallory distributor with advanced timing and twin pickup / amplifiers, air powered switchable exhaust routing, and a million gauges.  Sold running 4.3L 4 barrel engine for $800.  Runs great, almost touching 70mph very reliably.  Total investment, about $3000  Easy transplant, 4.3L and 350 are same engine, less 2 cylinders, everything transfers over.  4.3L V6 is a great engine.  5.7L is even more of that greatness.  Boat did 50-53 GPS with the tired factory 4 barrel 4.3L.  Now cranks 68mph GPS with a 25 pitch Mercury Mirage SS prop and 1.5 outdrive ratio @ 5500rpm.  Going for 70mph next year (leave the anchor at the dock, bump ignition timing up, run less fuel level, etc....).  Boat originally did not have through-hull exhaust.  Nees rub rail work and wo have bottom paint removed.  Would also like to install a nice teak swim platoform in the rear, used to have 2 small fiberglass platforms which sucked, I removed them.

I bought the car from a mate who has the swirl flaps removed in exchange for blanking plates
While the garage was doing the work they told him that 2 of the fuel injectors were letting fuel back in somehow dont really know 
They advised his to get them refurbed so he when ahead with it so just to be clear 2 were refurbed and the other 2 were only cleaned 

total cost £700 including the swirl flap job ouch!

When he got the car back he noticed when he revved the car he could hear a ticking noise and in normal driving conditions when he puts his foot down he can hear it 
He has tried to get the problem sorted but to no avail and just fobbed him off, he has now lost heart in the car and asked me if I wanted to buy it so I did 

I have made a little video in regards to the noise thats the ticking noise and louder under acceleration/load 

Please can anyone help me I dont want to spend lots on this car to get it right and dont want to get ripped off

Evinrude e-tec 90, 2011 model, three months old.  Fitted to old-school Caribbean Comaro (4.7m fibreglass runabout) made by International Marine, Scoresby, Australia, in the late 70's.  The new outboard has transformed this old girl into a brilliantly performing, low emissions pleasurecraft.  Achieved 70km/h @ 5200rpm on water-pickup style speedo with 17 inch Viper prop, yet to be verified by GPS... but it sure flies!

The puff of smoke you might see on the rev at idle is because it only has about three hours on the clock... so still in double-oiling run-in mode.   Notice that the telltale stream at 500rpm.  I've taken another video at 1000rpm to show the difference in stream as the engine speed rises.  There has been some debate about what is 'normal' and considering this is such a new engine, I consider this normal for this model.

IeW1hoTAXB8_30_40.wav,OK Supreme 1927 motorcycle with Bradshaw engine,"OK Supreme 1927  349 cc OHV   oil cooled Bradshaw 

OK motorcycles were manufactured by the firm of Humphries & Dawes  in Birmingham  from 1899 till 1939: from 1926, when one of the controlling partners left the firm, the company was  renamed OK Supreme. The motorcycles were built at  the Hall Green Works in Birmingham.  The company had some success in racing  in the twenties and was sufficiently well established to overcome the downturn in trade in the Depression years.
In the years before the Great War the company fitted among others  ""Precision"" engines, in the  early twenties  Union and Villiers two stroke power units were fitted. In the mid-twenties  the range consisted of  two stroke models  of 292 and 348 cc  cc,  the  sports tourer  OHV Bradshaw and sv and  ohv Blackburne power units.  Plenty of choice in engines!
From the late twenties the company used  mainly sv and ohv JAP engines, although  there was also a model with OK ohc engine for some years. Granville Bradshaw designed several oil cooled engines; the first was a 500 cc ohv flat twin which was used by Zenith  in 1920.  In 1921 the range was extended with a 350 cc ohv single and a 1000 cc V-twin. The engines were produced by  James Walmsley & Co in Preston and marketed by Gilbert Campling. From 1925 the engines were built by Dorman in Stafford.  The longstroke Bradshaw engine -- used by OK from 1924 to 1928 - has bore and  stroke dimensions of 68x96 mm  and  mechanical lubrication.  The machine  has a 3 speed gearbox and Brown & Barlow carburettor.  It weighs about 200 lbs, so it's a light and agile machine.",OK Supreme,Supreme,"{'manufacturer': 'Bradshaw', 'model': '349 cc OHV oil-cooled single', 'configuration': 'Single cylinder, OHV', 'displacement_cc': 349, 'cooling_system': 'Oil-cooled', 'bore_mm': 68, 'stroke_mm': 96}",Motorcycle,Gasoline,,no

bT-CEaOEGdI_140_150.wav,Starting 4 valve engine with ease from OORacing,"Hello
This is a short video of me starting the 4 valve high compression engines, it proves that when started in the right crank position they will start with ease and without any chance of a kick back or setting off the sheer gear.
We get a number of call saying the engines are imposable to kit over, but that is only due to they are trying to kick them over on the complete compression stroke.
Please watch and take note of the following
Don't use the choke with any of the carbs out there and use the idle screw as the choke by turning it up ½ a turn from its normal running.
Always do a trial kit with the ignition off just to make sure the bore is primed/clear of any excess fuel, do this on start up each time if left for more than 30 minutes.
Never open the throttle on start up.
Always warm the engine up on a fast idle for 3 to 5 minutes wit out blipping the throttle.
We hope this helps
