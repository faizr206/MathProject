Geoffrey King, a professional Engineer and member of the Newcomen Society, designed this 1/12th scale replica in 1958 from an example which was in service until 1921. With a bore x stroke of ¾"" x 1½"", the engine has a double acting slide valve with 4 bar guides, a marine type big-end, an eccentric driven feed pump, a hand cranked stop valve and a Watts type governor, driven by ordinary chain running in grooved pulleys. Under steam the engine is a delight, especially with its governor weighted for slow running.

Cab 7035 is on the point of 6 bi-levels, and most importantly, P40BH #4802 is the train's motive power.
It's a somewhat ""old"" engine considering all the modern power NJT has bought and run on the Newark Division recently. This locomotive was built by General Electric in 1993 for Amtrak, and was AMTK P40 #810. It's old-school technology too, a pretty 'classic' mechanical design I note here as ""old rumble"", like the GE diesels built decades beforehand. (think U34CH)

This elegant oscillating engine, producing 2nhp, was displayed under steam by Hick, Hargreave & Co at the Great Exhibition in 1851 where it powered a Ryder forging machine. Like all oscillating engines, it is a real joy to watch! Our model is a faithful ""foot to inch"" scale replica of the original, designed from company archives by Geoffrey King in 1957. This is a small engine which can be produced on virtually any lathe. The bore and stroke measure Ø7/16"" x 15/16"", the flywheel has a diameter of Ø3½"" and the complete model measures 5¾""x 3½"" x 5"" (LxWxH).",Hick & Son,Oscillating Engine,Oscillating Engine,none,stationary engine,steam,running,no,no

This knocking sound happens after the engine has heated up. It sounds like its coming straight from the engine block. The sound increases in speed when accelerating and remains (sometimes) in idle at stoplights. The oil light comes on often when the noise starts as well.
I changed the oil one month ago and replaced the oil filter. Also I just replaced all 4 spark plugs hoping the engine was just misfiring. The oil is still full, and doesn't smell burnt.

0QOCIr2WLds_30_40.wav,Engine Company Operations - LDH and Cavitation,"This short video clip was shot in Ashville, Ny during our October 2013 rural water supply seminar.  We had the opportunity to catch a 4-inch LDH supply line right at its ""collapse equilibirum point"" - where there is just enough pressure to keep it open. This is less than 1 psi - but because of the internal surface area of the hose, that pressure allows the hose to remain open and water to flow. While not an ideal situation, during the early phases of a large scale event, these things may occur until water supplies can be further supported by additional supply lines, pumpers, or sources. An experienced pump operator knows how to ""get the most"" out of his LDH supply line during rough times.

0n_uOR3PJFA_30_40.wav,1967 VE Valiant Regal (After Engine Rebuild),"Here is my 1967 VE Valiant Regal after I rebuilt the slant 6 and restored everything in the engine bay. I uploaded a video of my Valiant in 2009 where I commented that it had 20,000 miles on the odometer but after observing the huge oil consumption on a 650 kilometre drive to Albury/Wodonga for Chryslers On The Murray in 2010, I knew the engine needed some attention and had probably 220,000 miles on it. Once the head was removed to observe the level of wear, it could be seen that lips had formed at the tops of the bores and large amounts of carbon build up was present at the tops of the cylinders where oil was burning. The engine needed machining so I decided the engine deserved to be rebuilt to prevent any further wear to the block. This resulted in a full restoration of the engine and the engine bay was tidied up with a bare metal respray. All the components within the engine bay were rebuilt, reconditioned and refreshed with attention to keeping everything as original and factory as possible (within reason). The rebuild started in December 2011 and was roughly finished in October 2012. This is the end result.",Valiant,Regal,slant 6,inline-6,sedan,gasoline,running,no,yes

0xsh-y9zkns_0_10.wav,VW AMR 500 Supercharger in 1970 Bay - Second Idler pulley / Stalling on boost,"Stock 1600 twin port supercharger conversion in my early VW bay bus that I am developing as a kit. 

In this video I've added a second idler pulley to help with the belt slipping. Whilst the belt is not as wobbly as without it - it's still not a great fix. I will need to look into a spring loaded pulley arrangement to make sure the slack is kept out of the belt

Another thing to note is that the engine seems to want to stall when it comes on boost, not too sure what the cause is. You can see it in this video when I open the throttle fast - the boost increases and then the engine wants to stall. If I open the throttle slowly the engine will pick up speed no issue.

1L7sIG-2BHg_7_17.wav,Buran OMS Engine & Thruster Testing,"The Buran spacecraft was the only fully completed and operational space shuttle vehicle from the Soviet Buran program. With a design that borrowed heavily from the NASA Space Shuttle, the Buran completed one unmanned spaceflight in 1988 before cancellation of the Soviet shuttle program in 1993. The Buran was subsequently destroyed by a hangar collapse in 2002.

Like its NASA counterpart, the Buran, when in transit from its landing sites back to the launch complex, was transported on the back of a large jet aeroplane. It was piggy-backed on the Antonov An-225 Mriya aircraft, which was designed for this task and remains the largest aircraft in the world.

Several shuttles were produced. One of those, the OK-GLI, was modified to fly with jet engines for aerodynamic testing. One painted mock shuttle (the former static test-article OK-TVA) is now a ride simulating space flight in Gorky Park, Moscow. The OK-GLI was sold by its owner NPO Energia, shipped to Sydney in Australia and subsequently displayed at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. Shortly after, the new owner went bankrupt and the OK-GLI shuttle then went to Bahrain for a number of years while legal ownership status was in dispute. The Sydney/Bahrain (OK-GLI) shuttle was acquired by the German Technikmuseum Speyer in 2004,[2] and has been transported to the museum, where it is exhibited to the general public.",Soviet Buran program,Buran spacecraft,OMS Engine & Thruster,none,space shuttle,none,testing,no,no

1w4y1APGjaI_27_37.wav,"VW ""CT"" Engine - Head or cylinder stud problem?","Random video exhibiting a symptom of engine trouble which was finally investigated in a bit more depth this weekend on the van.

The ""chuffing"" or ""ticking"" noise you can hear here (no pun intended...) is the point of interest.  This is only really obvious at low revs when the engine is under load - above that it gets pretty much drowned out.  It's completely inaudible from inside the van with the engine cover in place.

This appears to be coming from the vicinity of cylinder number four.  When the engine turns over, it sounds like there's one cylinder which is somewhat down on compression, combined with a ""wheezing"" noise - so something isn't right somewhere.

Current advise seems to be suggesting that a broken head stud is the most likely cause...We'll see I guess once further investigation has taken place.

This is *not* a leaking exhaust manifold gasket.

My brother's 1992 Formula Firebird (5.0 L 305) engine started knocking yesterday, so I took my D90 and took a quick little video of it. The engine's in pretty sad shape, but hopefully will be fixed up in a few days.

I've been using the D90 as a handheld camera a little bit here and there, and I think I'm pretty safe in saying it's not meant to be a HandyCam replacement. I'll be testing it more in a film-like environment later, mounted on a tripod with nice lighting; I have a feeling the D90's more at home in that kind of setting.
